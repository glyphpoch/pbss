Welcome to Pbss's documentation!
================================
Pbss is a compiler that takes Python code and converts it into CSS. It parses a dictionary to generate CSS. It supports all native CSS units and colors. It supports nesting like HTML and you are not bound to writing Python in one file, you can break your code into multiple files and just call one method and Pbss will join the files for you. It supports color arithmetic which means you can add like **rgb** to another **rgb** or convert it to hex without doing complex math

This is the official documentation for Pbss containing all references and install instructions. If you want to go through a tutorial to build a basic web layout, click on the Pbss styled link to get a copy of the book
